# cyber-security-
Cyber security is a practice of protecting internet connected systems,data  from digital attacks,theft,damage  and unauthorized access .
there are 7 types of cyber security ,they are network security,application security,end point security,Iot security,information security,cloud security and operational security

**CIA TRAID**
CIA stands for confidentiality,integrity and availability
where confidentiality refers to keeping data private
Integrity refers to accuracy of data(no altration with out authentication)
Availability refers to accessabily of data free from altration and with accuracy

**TYPES OF ATTACKERS**
the are basically categorized by their motivations, skill levels, and resources. 
Script kiddies:they are inexperienced,uses pre exitsing tool to do cyber attack
INsiders:they belong or were belonged to group of authoried team.and misuse they authorization to damage the reputation of the group or company
Hackitivists:experienced.use hackinking techniques to promote social,political or ideaological thoughts.
National state actors:These attackers work for a nation (government) and carry out cyberattacks to spy, steal secrets, disrupt systems, or gain power over other countries.

**TYPES OF ATTACKS**
1.Malware-harmful software used by attackers are known as malware.when a mislinious link is been click this malware get installed and become active
2. Phishing – Fake emails or messages that trick you into sharing personal information.
3. Spoofing – Attackers pretend to be someone you trust to fool you.
4. Backdoor trojan– A hidden program that lets hackers control your device secretly.
5. Ransomware– Locks your files and asks for money to unlock them.
6. Password attacks – Hackers try to steal or guess your passwords.
7. IoT attack– Hackers attack smart devices like cameras or smart lights.
8. Cryptojacking– Hackers use your device to mine cryptocurrency without permission.
9. Drive-by download – Malware gets downloaded just by visiting an unsafe website.
10. Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack – Floods a system with traffic to make it stop working.

**Attacker Surface**
An attack surface means all the possible places where a hacker can try to enter or attack a system
1. Web Applications
Web applications (like online shopping sites or login pages) are common targets.
Attackers exploit weak passwords, insecure forms, or poor input validation to steal data or gain access.
2. Mobile Applications
Mobile apps can be attacked if they store data insecurely or use unsafe permissions.
Hackers may steal user data or inject malware through fake or modified apps.
3. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)
APIs allow different software systems to communicate.
If APIs lack proper authentication or authorization, attackers can access or manipulate sensitive data.
4. Networks
Networks include Wi-Fi, routers, and internal connections.
Attackers may intercept data, perform man-in-the-middle attacks, or gain access through unsecured networks.
5. Cloud Infrastructure
Cloud systems store data and run applications online.
Misconfigured storage, weak access controls, or exposed credentials can allow attackers to steal or delete data.

**OWASP Top 10 vulnerability description**
Broken Access Control – Users can see or do things they are not allowed to.
Cryptographic Failures – Sensitive data is not properly protected or encrypted.
Injection – Hackers put harmful code into input fields to control the system.
Insecure Design – The application is poorly planned with weak security from the start.
Security Misconfiguration – Wrong or default settings make the system unsafe.
Vulnerable and Outdated Components – Old software with known problems is still being used.
Identification and Authentication Failures – Weak login systems allow attackers to steal accounts.
Software and Data Integrity Failures – Hackers can change software or data without being detected.
Security Logging and Monitoring Failures – Attacks are not noticed because logging is weak.
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) – Hackers trick servers into accessing internal systems
